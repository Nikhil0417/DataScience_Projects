# DataScience_Projects
This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning algorithms on different datasets
## EEG Eye-state Prediction
## Online News Popularity Prediction
## K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
K-NN algorithm was implemented without the use of external libraries. Multiple functions were designed to calculate the accuracy, distance between the data points and for predicting the new data points' class.
## LDA & QDA Algorithms
Implemented LDA and QDA on a custom 2-class dataset
## Logistic Regression
Applied logistic regression on a slightly modified version of the MNIST dataset. The logistic regression algorithm was implemented without the use of external libraries.
## Page-ranking Algorithm
Implemented a function in python to compute an engivector for the given parameter matrix G. The function was implemented using the power method to iteratively compute such an engivector, and to halt the computation when the error is less than a certain prechosen threshold (eg., 1e-5).
